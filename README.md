## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

Hey there! I'm a passionate 19-year-old freelance graphic designer, 3D modeler, and coding enthusiast. I discovered my love for design and programming at a young age and have been honing my skills ever since.

As a full stack developer, I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development, my preference is with front-end development though. I find great satisfaction in creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces while ensuring the underlying functionality is robust and efficient.

When I'm not coding or designing, you can often find me exploring my other passions. I have a love for music and enjoy singing in my free time. Additionally, I have interests in woodworking and 3D printing, which allow me to enjoy crafting unique pieces and useful tools that combine functionality and aesthetic appeal!

If you have any exciting projects or ideas, I'd love to collaborate and bring them to life. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact information provided below. I look forward to hearing from you!
